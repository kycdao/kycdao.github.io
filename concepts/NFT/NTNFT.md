The concept of an NFT which is bound to an account has been discussed at length on various blockchains and has been referred to by a number of names:

- **Soulbound tokens** (SBTs)
- **Account/Address bound tokens** (ABTs)
- **Non-transferable NFTs** (NTNFTs)

As kycDAO supports multiple different blockchain types and each blockchain has its own implementation or standard (and sometimes multiple!), we've attempted to use the most popular standard on each blockchain and tried to ensure the smart contract interface is as similar as possible.

For a more detailed explanation of the smart contracts kycDAO uses, please see [:icon-log: Smart contracts](/for-developers/smart-contracts)

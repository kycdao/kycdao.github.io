The concept of an NFT which is bound to an account has been discussed at length on various blockchains and has been referred to by a number of names:

- **Soulbound tokens** (SBTs)
- **Account/Address bound tokens** (ABTs)
- **Non-transferable NFTs** (NTNFTs)

As kycDAO supports multiple different blockchain types and each blockchain has its own implementation or standard (and sometimes multiple!), we've attempted to use the most popular standard on each blockchain and tried to ensure the smart contract interface is as similar as possible.

For a more detailed explanation of our smart contracts please see [Smart contracts](/for-developers/smart-contracts)

## Why did kycDAO choose to use NFTs?

As the concept of a decentralized identity is such a common subject discussed in web3, solutions for how to implement it have also brought up some great discussions.

Another alternative for sharing information related to an identity are [verifiable credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) or VCs.

We've written a blog post summarizing our thoughts on the benefits and disadvantages of [NFTs vs VCs](https://blog.kycdao.xyz/nft_vs_vc/).

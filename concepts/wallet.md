kycNFTs are wallet independent. The NFTs are minted directly to your blockchain address, enabling the owner of the blockchain address to port between wallets without loosing their verifications. Web3 is about interoperability and we designed a framework that offers the highest level of flexibility using blockchain native primitives. 

Any web3 wallet can be used to mint the kycNFT on the supported chains. We keep extedning the list of supported wallet and the chains we support. 

If we missed a wallet, please get in touch via [here?]()

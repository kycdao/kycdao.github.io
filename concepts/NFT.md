NFTs (Non-fungible tokens) as a concept are prolific and they exist on almost every blockchain. For this reason kycDAO has used NFTs to represent a user's verification with us.

Unlike standard NFTs though, which can be traded with others, as these verifications only make sense when associated with a specific account or address, our NFTs are non-transferable.

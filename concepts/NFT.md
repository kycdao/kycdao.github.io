!!!info NFT
**NFT** stands for **Non-fungible token**. It is a unique asset which is stored on the blockchain.

NFTs as a concept are prolific and they exist on almost every blockchain. For this reason kycDAO has used NFTs to represent a user's verification with us.

Unlike standard NFTs though, which can be traded with others, as these verifications only make sense when associated with a specific account or address, our NFTs are non-transferable.

# Composable Compliance 


!!! TL;DR
**kycDAO is a web3 native effort designed to enable compliance for web3.**
<br>
<br>
kycDAO links verified accounts to blockchain address to create a composable compliance primitive.

### Join kycDAO

+++ :zap: Join as a [!badge variant="primary" size="L" text="partner"] 
We invite protocols, companies, multi-sigs, DAOs, CeFIs, on-ramps and Banks committed to making web3 global to join the kycDAO framework to create a shared web3 native composable compliance infrastructure. Like any other web3 primitive, compliance must be a building block within a decentralized infrastructure stack. As a community, we can enable decentralized services to align with regulations while avoiding industry fragmentation and preventing centralization.

kycDAO is the first interoperable web3 due diligence and compliance framework. Partners of kycDAO enable members to link their wallets to their compliant account using a proof (Soulbound NFT & Verifiable Credential). Web3 projects and smart contracts can use these proofs to create compliant services without knowing their users.



## Background

The unregulated crypto markets enabled innovation at an unprecedented pace, increasingly blurring the line between web2 and web3; the quest to establish trust is foundational.  
Crypto, tokens, NFTs _(non-fungible tokens)_, DAOs _(decentralized autonomous organizations)_, and DeFi _(Decentralized Finance)_ are part of the consciousness, yet “crypto” has a tarnished reputation. The scams, rug-pulls, and hacks seriously deteriorated trust in web3, hindering the real scale of adoption and growth.

> **The next cycle in crypto will center around trust.**
> 


Web3 has matured along with its recognition from a niche sub-culture to pop culture level fame and from obscure forum entries to the desks of regulators. Contrary to the early days of blockchains, solving for trust is imperative and competitive advantage. The untapped opportunity of trust will be at the forefront of the next cycle. 

To prepare web3 for the next cycle, kycDAO is solving the quest of linking web2 type compliant verifications to web3 as a baseline for trust. The opportunities are limitless when we solve pseudonymous trust and bridge the real and the metaverse.


## A trusted ecosystem

**kycDAO is compliance designed for web3**. 

kycNFTs are the core building blocks of the broader kycDAO trust infrastructure. The multi-chain framework combines web3 primitives while maintaining support for the globally evolving regulatory compliance requirements. The soulbound NFTs minted by verified kycDAO members are composable proofs to build a trusted ecosystem. 

> By the issuers of the framework managing liability, kycDAO offers a unique web3 infrastructure component, a composable proof of pseudo-anonymous compliance.
> 

kycDAO takes privacy seriously, and no PII (Personal Identifiable Information) is ever published on chain, and access to PII will always require consent.

*One-off verifications do not meet compliance requirements, rendering them equal to centralized proof-of-human verifications. Web3 has already developed efficient Proof-of-Himan [Sybil resistant] services collected under [Gitcoin Passport](https://www.notion.so/DeFi-277b37d711674b54b4540a21ef018e13).*




## Use cases


+++ NFTs :icon-image: 
- A bourgeoising aspect of web3 that took the sector by surprise. The speed at which NFTs became part of the pop culture and reached segments of the population who were new to crypto. NFTs, while bringing personalization to the dry crypto ecosystem, also brought new breeds of scams tarnishing the reputation NFTs would deserve.
- Ensuring the trusted trade of NFTs could offer safer participation in combating the numerous issues surrounding crypto.
- Founders, artists, or Multisig holder verification could ensure trust in projects that might have difficulty developing a trusting user base.
+++ Games :icon-rocket:
- web3 gaming is only testing its early potential. As gaming took over the top spot as the most grossing entertainment sector, the introduction of true ownership and new markets will enable the sector to go through a revolution. Games already combat bots and in-game farming; however, decentralization introduces a new layer of complexity.
- Using kycNFTs, players could ensure they are playing only with verified members or parts of the metaverses, or markets could be limited to only trusted players ensuring financial compliance and combat bots.
+++ DAOs :icon-code-of-conduct:
- The space DAOs occupy receives growing scrutiny from legal experts. The uncertainty around individual liability is moving the ecosystem toward a safe direction to establish legal wrappers and mitigate personal liability. kycNFTs enable DAOs to ensure their members are not sanctioned and meet required verification requirements without accessing the data of their members. Using kycNFTs, DAOs can run fair voting based on proof of unique human metadata.
+++ Social :icon-globe:
- Early communities were solidified through ,ICOs IDOs and most recently, through an ever more sophisticated array of airdrops. Many of these token distribution events obtained legal and compliance reviews and often implemented tooling to meet the requirements.
- Sovereign social or web3 social is a growing sector with many initiatives entering the space to compete for the opportunity. A common risk that even web2 social platforms combat is the extensive presence of automated bots. The risk bots propose in decentralized social media is significantly more due to the purposeful lack of oversight. Verified users could be a form of human-to-human trust; just as users of Twitter trust more verified users, wallets with kycNFts could be trusted.
+++ On/Off ramps :icon-arrow-switch:
- These essential payment rails fall under the same scrutiny as most financial services. Ramps interacting with a pre-verified account, the user can access payment flows easier. At the same time, the level of trust required by services is met.
+++ Defi :icon-law: 
- With the use of gated DeFi protocols, a new wave of institutional liquidity can be unlocked that has been waiting on the sidelines. Gated DeFi allows one to blur lines between TradFi and DeFi and apply the most efficient market mechanisms while meeting compliance requirements.

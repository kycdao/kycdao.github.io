### SDK functions

+++ Gating
Ensuring that certain functions and services are only access by wallets that have a valid kycNFT, kycDAO SDKs offer this functionality to shorten integration time. 
+++ Verification
kycDAO is a multi-issuer (verifier) framework and wallet owners can chose their preferred account to link to their wallet. kycDAO offers a default partner, Veri Labs, a purpose built service to streamline verifications in the web3 space. 
+++ Minting
kycDAO soulbound NFT minting is authorised by kycDAO's backend to allow only trusted wallets to mint a soulbound proof. Minting can be subsidized by projects or the minting fee is added to the calculated gas paid by the user.

## Overview

This document describes the main ways to embed kycDAO SDKs to web3 services. 

The kycDAO SDK provides APIs and interfaces you can use to integrate with kycDAO verification services.

kycDAO offers two SDKs for integrating your site with our service.

- A [JS/TS SDK](/for-developers/sdks/typescript-sdk) which allows a site to fully customize their UI/UX by making the calls to the kycDAO service from their own UI components.
- A [UI SDK](/for-developers/sdks/ui-sdk) which is a quick way to integrate the kycDAO service by embedding the kycDAO UX flow in a popup window.

Payment is required for minting an NFT, as there is a cost associated with each of the verification processes.

## Payment methods

### User pays

The simplest method for payment is simply for the user to pay during the minting transaction itself.

### Organisation pays

It's also possible for an organisation to 'pre-pay' for their users, making it free for them to mint their kycNFTs. If you're interested in this please [get in touch](/support)

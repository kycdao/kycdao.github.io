## add soulbound here 


!!!info NFT
**NFT** stands for **Non-fungible token**. It is a unique asset which is stored on the blockchain.
!!!

NFTs as a concept are prolific and they exist on almost every blockchain. For this reason kycDAO use a special type of NFTs to represent a user's verification.

Unlike most standard NFTs, kycNFTs represent identity verifications and these only make sense when associated with a specific account or address, therefore, our NFTs are designed to be non-transferable.

## Why did kycDAO choose to use soulbound NFTs?

As the concept of a decentralized identity is such a common subject discussed in web3, solutions for how to implement it have also brought up some great discussions.

Another commonly recognized alternative for sharing information related to an identity are [verifiable credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) or VCs.

We've written a blog post summarizing our thoughts on the benefits and disadvantages of [NFTs vs VCs](https://blog.kycdao.xyz/nft_vs_vc/).

Payment is required for minting an NFT, as there is a cost associated with each of the verification processes.

## Payment methods

### User pays

The simplest method for payment is simply for the user to pay during the minting transaction itself.

### Organisation pays (Take out)

It's also possible for an organisation to 'pre-pay' for their users, making it free for them to mint their kycNFTs. If you're interested in this please [get in touch](/support)

## Supported currencies (update with token list per chains)

We plan to support both the native currency and the most common stable coin on each chain.

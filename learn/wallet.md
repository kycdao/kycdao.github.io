kycNFTs are wallet independent. Web3 is about interoperability and kycDAO framework offers maximum flexibility using blockchain native primitives. 

kycNFTs are minted directly to the connected blockchain address, enabling the member to port between wallets without losing their trusted membersip proof.

kycDAO supported wallets: 
- [WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.com/) _(ecosysten)_
- [Phantom](https://phantom.app/) _(native)_
- [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) _(native)_

We will keep extending of supported wallets as our ecosystem grows. 

## Multi-wallet 

Currently a member can only link one wallet to their compliant account, however, we are already working on a solution to allow multi-wallet support. Stay tuned.

>kycNFTs are wallet independent. 

Web3 is about interoperability and kycDAO framework offers maximum flexibility using blockchain native primitives. 

kycNFTs are minted directly to the connected blockchain address, enabling our member to port between wallets without losing the trusted membersip proof.

Blockchains are not the same, neither our contracts. We retain core functionality between deployed contracts, but our implementation of the kycNFT will always follow the chain's best practices.

### Multi-wallet 

Currently a member can only link one wallet to their compliant account. This is a limitation we accepted temporarily. It means, members are not yet able to link different wallets together. 

However, kycDAO is already working on a solution to allow multi-wallet linking. Stay tuned.

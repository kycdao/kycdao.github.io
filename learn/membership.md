kycDAO has an annual membership fee, similar to ENS's rent. 
The difference is that kycDAO's soulbound NFT expire while ENS revokes its rented NFTs. kycNFTs represent a compliant account holder, while ENS names serve as a powerful tool to simplify crypto transactions. They are both a type of identity, but they are very different.

- The fee is paid together with the first kycNFT mint. 
    - first mint: [!badge variant="info" text="_[number of years]_ x $5"] + [!badge variant="info" text="GAS"]
    - every following mint: [!badge variant="info" text="GAS"]

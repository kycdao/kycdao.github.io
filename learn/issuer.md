## Verification Issuer of kycDAO

=== ðŸ’¡ kycDAO is the web3 compliance framework
===

Verification issuers of kycDAO enable wallet owners to prove their status of valid verification towards web3 services and smart contracts by minting a soulbound signature as a kycNFT. 

Minted kycNFTs do NOT store any personal information nor represent the issuer. The core component of the NFT is a valid/invalid status controlled (directly or indirectly) by the issuer through the smart contract of kycNFT. *(Technical details on how a change of status can be implemented kycDAO has several mechanisms to support BackendAPI, FrontEndAPI, Credential, Verifiable Credential, and other means).* All minted kycNFT holder walletâ€™s will have ongoing web3 compliance (KYT) checked to meet web3 compliance requirements. 

Every verification issued within the kycDAO framework must meet the requirements set by kycDAO to ensure that all pseudonymous verifications in web3 will provide an equal level of compliance. This enables gated web3 services to stay decentralized while operating a compliant service.

Issuers of kycDAO take liability for the identity verifications as they onboard the users to their entity as a customer. kycDAO framework enables these verifications to become reusable across blockchains and ecosystems. 

### To become an issuer
A company must provide evidence to the kycDAO compliance board about the compliance processes, verification and data retention and storage practeices to be able to meet regulatory requirements. 


### Long-term
kycDAO will incentivize issuers to become verifications consumers, enabling the kycDAO framework to have verified users able to move between services accepting the verifications. This would allow frictionless user onboarding while backing the compliance process previously carried out by another issuer(s). 

### The benefits to become an issuer 

- enable web3 wallet holders to reuse their verifications (KYC / KYB / Accreditation) across blockchains and ecosystem
- enable web3 services to develop trusted tools and services on public blockchains
- enable web2 to blur with web3  using web3 primitives while meeting web2 requirements
    - develop new novel and services tools using compliant verifications
- Frictionless onboarding of any users with a kycDAO verification.

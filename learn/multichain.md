We are headed to a multichain world and we are designing our solutions for this paradigm. 

kycNFTs are wallet independent. <br>
The NFTs are minted directly to your blockchain address, enabling the owner of the blockchain address to port between wallets without loosing their verifications. <br>
Web3 is about interoperability and we designed a framework that offers full flexibility using blockchain native primitives. 

Many wallets support multiple chains already, but there are still nescant tools that specialize for specific blockcahins.

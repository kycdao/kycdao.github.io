## Overview

kycDAO offers two SDKs for integrating your site with our service.

- A [Typescript SDK](/SDKs/typescript-sdk) which allows a site to fully customize their UI/UX by making the calls to the kycDAO service from their own UI components.
- An [Embedded SDK](/SDKs/embedded-sdk) which is a quick way to integrate the kycDAO service by embedding the kycDAO UX flow in a popup window.
